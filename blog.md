Welcome to the Marvel battles app!

This app covers the Marvel Cinematic Universe of 20(!) films. It is difficult to keep track of what happened in each one. I made this app to help.

There is an account signup with name and password. Facebook may also be used to sign up.

A user logs in to the service and can then create characters, movies, and battles to categorize and save. I have seeded a lot of information, so make sure to rails db:seed before use.
